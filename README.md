The board is designed around the Ti [TPS61169](http://www.ti.com/product/TPS61169) WLED driver. The drivers are connected to the hardware PWM signals of the RPi. Keep in mind that you can't keep the LEDs on for a long time due to almost non-existant heat dissipation capacity of the PCB. The camera can be mounted in the center of the board. If you're using the default 11mm spacers you can fit the camera in the center of the board when folding the cable thightly.
